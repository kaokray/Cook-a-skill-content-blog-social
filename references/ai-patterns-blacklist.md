# AI-Pattern Blacklist — Auto Content Blog

When writing in Stage 4, never use any phrase on this list.
If you catch yourself writing one: stop and rewrite starting with a fact or direct claim.

---

## Openers & Fillers

These phrases add zero information and signal AI generation immediately:

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "When it comes to..." (cut it — start with the subject)
- "It's important to note that..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "Have you ever wondered...?" (rhetorical opener)
- "As we explore in this article..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Suffice it to say..."

**Fix:** Open sections with a specific fact, number, or direct statement instead.

---

## Inflated Adjectives & Verbs

Vague words that sound impressive but say nothing specific:

- "Leverage" (used abstractly) → use "use" or "apply"
- "Empower" → use "help [person] do [specific thing]"
- "Delve into" / "Dive into" → use "explore", "look at", "break down"
- "Unlock the potential of..." → say what the potential actually is
- "Game-changer" → describe the actual impact
- "Revolutionary" → describe what specifically changed
- "Transformative" → describe the before/after
- "Comprehensive" → describe what's actually covered
- "Navigate the complexities of..." → be specific about what's complex

---

## Clunky Transitions

These create robotic rhythm:

- "Furthermore,"
- "Moreover,"
- "Additionally,"
- "In conclusion," (especially at the start of a conclusion)
- "To summarize,"
- "In summary,"

**Fix:** Connect ideas within sentences, or just start the next point directly.

---

## Overused Connectors

- "Not only... but also..." → state both things separately
- "Both... and..." (when overused as a crutch)

---

## The Represents-Pattern (Conclusion Red Flag)

These cluster in AI-written conclusions:

- "[X] represents a..." → rewrite: "[X] is..."
- "[X] represents the future of..." → state the specific change that will happen
- "[X] represents a significant shift..." → "Since [year], [X] has changed how [people do Y]"

---

## Formatting Red Flags

- Bullet dashes: `- item` → use numbered lists (`1.`) or rewrite as prose
- Mid-sentence dashes: `X - Y` → rewrite as 2 sentences or use a comma/colon
- Em dashes: `X — Y` → same fix

---

## Conclusion Killers

The conclusion is where AI patterns cluster most heavily. Scan it separately:

- "In conclusion," / "To summarize," / "In summary,"
- "We hope this article has helped you..."
- "The future of [X] is bright"
- "Now is the time to embrace [X]"
- "As we have seen throughout this article..."
- Restating every H2 as bullet points → instead: synthesize into 2–3 sentences of insight
