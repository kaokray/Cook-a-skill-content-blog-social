# Cook-a-skill-auto-content-blog

## What problem does this skill solve?

Content Writers spend 5–8 hours producing one blog post: manual keyword research, writing a brief, drafting, checking SEO — and almost always skip the UGC step (mining community comments) because it is too time-consuming. The result is generic content with no human voice that AI search engines like Perplexity and Google SGE rarely cite.

**Content Pipeline Pro** automates the entire workflow down to **15–25 minutes per article** — with real UGC from X and Reddit embedded, and GEO optimization built into every stage.

## Pipeline

```
[0] X Trend Monitor  →  auto-propose hot keywords on session start
[1] Keyword Research →  scored, data-backed keyword selection
[2] Content Brief    →  outline mapped to keywords + UGC insertion points
[3] UGC Enrichment   →  mine comments → ready-to-paste blog sections
[4] Draft            →  human-style, data-backed, zero AI patterns
[5] SEO + GEO        →  on-page checklist + AI-bot-friendly formatting
[6] QA Report        →  rubric score + publish verdict
```

## How to run a demo

1. Open Claude Project → paste the contents of `SKILL.md` into Project Instructions
2. Upload your `project_spec.md` file into the Project
3. Open a new conversation → Stage 0 runs automatically and proposes hot X trends
4. Type `go with Trend 1` or enter your own keyword → pipeline runs from Stage 1

**Quick commands:**
- `run full pipeline` → Stage 0 through Stage 6
- `start from stage 3` → enter at UGC enrichment
- `score my draft` → enter at Stage 5
