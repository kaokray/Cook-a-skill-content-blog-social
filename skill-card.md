# Skill Card — Auto Content Blog

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Skill Name** | Auto Content Blog |
| **What gets automated** | The full blog production workflow — from detecting trending topics on X, keyword research, content brief, mining real UGC from community discussions, writing a human-style draft, auto-generating data charts + resolving all source citations to live hyperlinks, to SEO + GEO optimization and pre-publish QA scoring |
| **BEFORE: manual process** | Manual keyword research (~1h) → write brief (~30 min) → write draft (~3–5h) → manually find + add source links (~30 min) → self-check SEO (~30 min) → no UGC step, no data charts, no GEO optimization. Total: **5–8 hours per article**. Output quality varies by writer. High chance of missing trends when offline. |
| **AFTER: with skill** | Open session → Stage 0 auto-proposes hot X trends → pick keyword → Stage 1–6 runs the full pipeline → publish-ready blog article with embedded data charts, 100% hyperlinked citations, and QA report. Total: **15–25 minutes per article**. Consistent format every time. Real community UGC embedded. GEO-optimized for AI search engine citation. |
| **Tools / AI used** | Claude Project (SKILL.md as instruction), web search (Stage 0 trend monitor + Stage 1 keyword research + Stage 4 data sourcing + Stage 4.5 source URL resolution), web_fetch (Stage 3 UGC mining from X/Reddit threads + Stage 4.5 URL verification), Python + matplotlib (Stage 4.5 data chart generation) |
| **Limitations** | Stage 0 is simulated monitoring via web search — not a live X API connection. Keyword volume is estimated unless user provides Ahrefs/SEMrush API key. Does not auto-publish to CMS. Does not generate editorial/decorative images (Stage 4.5 generates data charts only). UGC mining limited to publicly accessible pages. SEO/GEO scores are internal rubric estimates, not third-party tool scores. Paywalled source URLs are linked to publisher homepage and flagged `[VERIFY URL]` for human review. |
| **Expansion roadmap** | (1) Real X API integration for true 24/7 live monitoring. (2) Ahrefs/SEMrush API for exact keyword volume data. (3) AI-generated featured images to complement Stage 4.5 data charts. (4) Multi-format output: 1 blog → Twitter thread + LinkedIn post + Telegram post automatically. (5) Content Calendar: input 10 keywords → full monthly content plan. (6) Performance tracking: monitor post-publish ranking and traffic, feed results back to improve the skill. |
