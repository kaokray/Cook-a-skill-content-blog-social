# Skill Card — Auto Content Blog

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Skill Name** | Auto Content Blog |
| **Skill files** | `SKILL_en.md` (pipeline instructions) + `spec_v4_en.md` (project spec) — both written in English. Article output is always in Vietnamese, hard-coded and cannot be overridden by any user request. |
| **What gets automated** | The full blog production workflow — from detecting trending topics on X, keyword research, content brief with UGC insertion points, mining real community voice from X/Reddit threads, writing a human-style Vietnamese draft with zero AI patterns, auto-generating data charts + resolving all source citations to live hyperlinks, to SEO + GEO optimization and a rubric-based pre-publish QA report. |
| **BEFORE: manual process** | Manual keyword research (~1h) → write brief (~30 min) → write draft (~3–5h) → manually find + add source links (~30 min) → self-check SEO (~30 min) → no UGC step, no data charts, no GEO optimization, no writing rules enforcement. Total: **5–8 hours per article**. Output quality varies by writer. High chance of missing trends when offline. |
| **AFTER: with skill** | Open session → Stage 0 auto-proposes 3 hot X trends before you type anything → pick keyword → Stages 1–6 run the full pipeline → publish-ready Vietnamese blog article with embedded data charts, 100% hyperlinked citations, enforced writing rules, and a scored QA report. Total: **15–25 minutes per article**. Consistent format every time. Real community UGC embedded. GEO-optimized for AI search engine citation. |
| **Pipeline stages** | `[0]` X Trend Monitor — auto-run on session start, scores and proposes top 3 trending topics `[1]` Keyword Research — 8–12 seed keywords scored by volume, difficulty, trend direction, X buzz `[2]` Content Brief & Outline — flow pattern selection, long-tail keyword map, UGC insertion points flagged `[3]` UGC Enrichment — fetch X/Reddit comments, quality-score, classify into counter-arguments / real-world FAQs / personal experiences, map to outline `[4]` Draft — full Vietnamese article, min 3 sourced data points, zero AI patterns, writing rules enforced `[4.5]` Visual & Link Enrichment — data charts via Python + matplotlib, all source citations converted to live hyperlinks `[5]` SEO + GEO Optimization — on-page checklist + 7 GEO rules for Perplexity / Google SGE / ChatGPT Search `[6]` QA Scoring Report — 100-point SEO rubric + GEO checklist + writing rules check + publish verdict |
| **Writing rules enforced (Stage 4)** | No "-" or "—" symbols in body text (AI detection risk). Numbers formatted as M/B/$M/$B throughout. Only H1/H2/H3 headings — no H4/H5/H6. Banned AI phrase list (English + Vietnamese equivalents) checked before output. Logical sentence flow, not isolated bullet-point sentences. Up to 10% light emotion allowed; no fake or excessive emotion. |
| **Output language** | **Vietnamese — locked.** All article drafts, UGC blocks, FAQ answers, intros, and conclusions are always in Vietnamese. Pipeline instructions, QA reports, keyword tables, and stage notes are in English. This cannot be changed by any user instruction. |
| **Tools / AI used** | Claude Project with `SKILL_en.md` as instruction file, web search (Stage 0 trend monitor + Stage 1 keyword research + Stage 4 data sourcing + Stage 4.5 source URL resolution), `web_fetch` (Stage 3 UGC mining from X/Reddit threads + Stage 4.5 URL verification), Python + matplotlib (Stage 4.5 data chart generation — up to 6 charts per article, 150 DPI, #E8650A brand color) |
| **Inputs** | Required: `project_spec` (.md) + `keyword_or_topic`. Optional: `ugc_urls` (Stage 3 skipped if absent), `blog_draft`, `word_count` (default 1,500–2,000), `tone` (default: auto-detect from spec) |
| **Quick commands** | `run full pipeline` → Stage 0 through Stage 6. `start from stage [N]` → enter at any stage. `score my draft` → Stage 5–6 only. `enrich my draft` → Stage 4.5 only (charts + links on existing draft). |
| **Limitations** | Stage 0 is simulated X monitoring via web search — not a live X API. Keyword volume is estimated unless user provides Ahrefs/SEMrush API key. Does not auto-publish to CMS. Does not generate editorial or decorative images (Stage 4.5 produces data charts only). UGC mining limited to publicly accessible pages. SEO/GEO scores are internal rubric estimates, not third-party tool scores. Paywalled source URLs are linked to publisher homepage and flagged `[VERIFY URL]` for human review. Vague citations ("experts say") are flagged `[SOURCE NEEDED]` — never invented. |
| **Expansion roadmap** | (1) Real X API integration for true 24/7 live monitoring. (2) Ahrefs/SEMrush API for exact keyword volume. (3) AI-generated featured images to complement Stage 4.5 data charts. (4) Multi-format output: 1 blog → Twitter thread + LinkedIn post + Telegram post automatically. (5) Content Calendar: input 10 keywords → full monthly content plan. (6) Performance tracking: monitor post-publish ranking and traffic, feed results back to improve the skill. (7) Batch mode: 10 keywords → 10 articles + 10 QA reports in one run. |
